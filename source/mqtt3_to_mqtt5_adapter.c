/*
 * The lock is held during callbacks to prevent invoking into something that is in the process of
 * destruction.  In general this isn't a performance worry since callbacks are invoked from a single
 * thread: the event loop that the client and adapter are seated on.
 *
 * But since we don't have recursive mutexes on all platforms, we need to be careful about the shutdown
 * process since if we naively always locked, then an adapter release inside a callback would deadlock.
 *
 * On the surface, it seems reasonable that if we're in the event loop thread we could just skip
 * locking entirely (because we've already locked it at the start of the callback).  Unfortunately, this isn't safe
 * because we don't actually truly know we're in our mqtt5 client's callback; we could be in some other
 * client/connection's callback that happens to be seated on the same event loop.  And while it's true that because
 * of the thread seating, nothing will be interfering with our shared state manipulation, there's one final
 * consideration which forces us to *try* to lock:
 *
 * Dependent on the memory model of the CPU architecture, changes to shared state, even if "safe" from data
 * races across threads, may not become visible to other cores on the same CPU unless some kind of synchronization
 * primitive (memory barrier) is invoked.  So in this extremely unlikely case, we use try-lock to guarantee that a
 * synchronization primitive is invoked when disable is coming through a callback from something else on the same
 * event loop.
 *
 * In the case that we're in our mqtt5 client's callback, the lock is already held, try fails, and the unlock at
 * the end of the callback will suffice for cache flush and synchronization.
 *
 * In the case that we're in something else's callback on the same thread, the try succeeds and its followup
 * unlock here will suffice for cache flush and synchronization.
 *
 * Some after-the-fact analysis hints that this extra step (in the case where we are in the event loop) may
 * be unnecessary because the only reader of the state change is the event loop thread itself.  I don't feel
 * confident enough in the memory semantics of thread<->CPU core bindings to relax this though.
